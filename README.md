# Movie-recommendation-System
ETL - Recommendation system - cosine similarity - categorical data processing

**Time spent :** one afternoun

**Context :**
This is a very basic recomendation system based on movies metadata like genre, cast, director, tags etc..
It is obviously very limited since it does not take into account demographics or cultural features (based on what similar users have liked) except maybe the average vote and the popularity (I kept only movies above the median)

I had fun doing it even though the recommended movies are not really diversified due to the limited number of features !

**What I learned :**
I learned a new way to process categorical data by creating a soup and vectorizing it. 

Hope you will enjoy !
